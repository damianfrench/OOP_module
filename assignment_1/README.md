# Assignment 1 - The Bohr Atom
Building a script to use the Bohr model to determine the energy of a photon for an electron transitioning between two energy levels for a specific atomic number.

## Inputs

This script asks the user for 4 inputs in the terminal, Z, n_i, n_j and units.
Z is the atomic number of the atomic they want to use the Bohr model for, n_i is the initial energy level, n_j is the energy level to be transitioned to and units is what units they want the output to be in.\\

The options for Z is any number that is is greater than 0 and less than 118, which is the atomic number of the heaviest known element.\\

The options for n (both) is any integer greater than 0.\\

The options for units is either Joules (J) or eV (e).\\

The inputs must be seperated by either spaces of each on a new line.\\

## outputs

The result is outputted to terminal, as well as any errors that are thrown.\\
After each calculation the user is asked if they want to do another, where they need to enter either (y/n) to continue or end then program.
